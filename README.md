# HyperUX: AI-Driven Dynamic Hyper-Personalisation UX

**HyperUX** is an open-source tool that helps optimising user experience through dynamic, AI-driven hyper-personalisation, it uses real-time user behaviour to dynamically personalise the UI, enhancing usability, engagement, and satisfaction.

## üöÄ Project Overview

HyperUX is designed to integrate AI-driven behavioural analytics into fintech and banktech web and mobile applications. The core idea is simple yet powerful: instead of offering a one-size-fits-all interface, HyperUX continuously learns from user interactions, dynamically personalising the UI to enhance usability, engagement, and satisfaction.

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Personalisation**: The system adapts the UI based on real-time user behaviour, improving user engagement without manual intervention.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built with scalability in mind, HyperUX can grow with additional models and complexities as needed.
- **Easy Integration**: A lightweight JavaScript SDK allows for seamless integration with popular frontend frameworks like React and Vue.js.
- **Ethical Design**: The system prioritise data privacy and algorithmic transparency, ensuring ethical use of AI in personalisation.

## üõ†Ô∏è System Architecture

HyperUX's architecture is composed of the following key components:

1. **Data Collection Module**: A lightweight JavaScript SDK that captures user interactions (clicks, scrolls, form inputs) and sends the data to the backend asynchronously, ensuring a smooth user experience.
2. **AI/LLM Wrapper Module**: This module analyses user behaviour data to generate insights and UI adaptation recommendations. It focuses on basic behavioural analysis and rule-based personalisation, with the potential for more complex algorithms as the project evolves.
3. **User Interface Adaptation Module**: Dynamically adjusts the UI in real-time based on insights from the AI/LLM engine, tailoring the experience to each user's preferences and behaviours.
4. **API Layer**: Facilitates seamless communication between the frontend, backend, and the various system modules.
5. **Data Storage**: Securely stores user interaction data and insights, designed to scale with increasing data volumes.

## üë• Contributing

HyperUX is an open-source project, and I welcome contributions from anyone passionate about AI, fintech, or user experience design. Whether you're a developer, data scientist, or UX designer, there are plenty of opportunities to get involved:

- **Developers**: Help us enhance the AI/LLM processing engine or optimise the SDK for various frontend frameworks.
- **Data Scientists**: Contribute to improving our behavioural analysis models or explore new personalisation algorithms.
- **UX Designers**: Share your insights on how to improve the user interface adaptation strategies.
