OUTPUT EXAMPLE

[

		"title": "'Add to Cart' button is located below the fold.",
		"description": "Users have to scroll down to find the 'Add to Cart' button since it is located below the fold. Elements close to each other are usually considered related and having more options leads to harder decisions. Try to move the 'Add to Cart' button where it is immediately visible to the user. Also try to declutter the options so that the user can find the CTA easily.",
		"category": "Quick Win",
		"relevant_patterns": [
			"Rule of Proximity",
			"Hicks Law",
		],
	}
]

```
